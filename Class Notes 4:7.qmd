lets look at airquality first: are wind and temp independent

```{r}
glimpse(airquality)
```

null: wind and temp are independent - slope of regression line is 0. 

alternative: not independent - slope is nonzero

```{r}
ggplot(airquality,
       aes(x = Wind,
           y = Temp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
model <- lm(Temp ~ Wind,
            data = airquality)

summary(model)
```

pvalue is basically 0, indicates strong evidence for the alternative, Temp and Wind are not independent. 

# Regression from the practical perspective

lets leave inference aside for a moment
