lets look at airquality first: are wind and temp independent

```{r}
glimpse(airquality)
```

null: wind and temp are independent - slope of regression line is 0. 

alternative: not independent - slope is nonzero

```{r}
ggplot(airquality,
       aes(x = Wind,
           y = Temp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
